# ML-CyberSec: Machine Learning Meets Cybersecurity

Welcome to the ML-CyberSec repo! This is a collection of experimental projects exploring the intersection of machine learning and various cybersecurity domains. Nothing too serious here, just a playground for tinkering and testing out different ML techniques in a security context.

## What's Inside?

This repo is organized into several folders, each tackling a different cybersecurity problem using machine learning approaches. These are more proofs of concept than production-ready solutions:

- [ ] `malware-detection`: Experimenting with ML models for detecting malicious software based on file characteristics and system behavior.
- [ ] `network-intrusion-detection`: Exploring the use of machine learning algorithms to identify network intrusions and cyber attacks.
- [ ] `phishing-detection`: Testing ML models for classifying emails, messages, and websites as potential phishing attempts.
- [ ] `user-behavior-analytics`: Investigating user behavior analytics with machine learning to detect potential insider threats or compromised accounts.
- [ ] `vulnerability-detection`: Applying machine learning techniques to analyze source code, network configurations, and system settings for vulnerabilities.
- [ ] `fraud-detection`: Experimenting with ML-based approaches for detecting various types of online fraud.
- [ ] `anomaly-detection`: Using machine learning algorithms to identify anomalies in network traffic, system logs, and other data sources.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo if you're interested in taking a look:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-cybersec.git

cd ml-cybersecurity

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Explore the individual folders and their respective READMEs for instructions on running the experiments and understanding the underlying concepts.
